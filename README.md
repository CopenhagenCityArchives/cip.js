Integrated AJAX library
-----------------------
Right now I'm using [qwest] becuase the interface is neat. It's about 4KiB.
Another possibility is [reqwest] but it weighs in at just under 9 KiB and I
don't find the interface as nice.

qwest uses the MIT license.

There definitely are smaller AJAX libraries out there like [jx] but I don't find
them as clear and well-documented as `qwest`.
